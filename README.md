Bad Bank

Description:
This Bad Bank project is my final project for my MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. Bad Bank allows users to create a banking account (with a $2000 sign on bonus!). They will then be able to login to their account, withdraw money, deposit money and see their balance.
